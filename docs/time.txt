1 h Begin writing plan and structs

Tue 05-17
1 h Make a wavetable mixer
.25 h Set up VC; plan to write test tracks

Wed 05-18
1 h Make a test track; realize need for a hash table to parse it
2.5 h Begin hash table [tentative]

Thu 05-19
.25 h Collect 2 more test tracks

Sun 05-22
.75 h Build keyword hash function

Thu 05-26
3.5 h Parse instrument and order data in a FamiTracker text export

Mon 05-30
1 h Parse pattern note, instrument, and volume

Sun 06-05
1.75 h Parse effects; parse note, instrument, and volume all the way through a nontrivial piece
4.5 h Stuff macro, instrument, wave, pattern header, and order table into a struct

Mon 06-06
.75 h Stuff pattern rows into a struct
.25 h Move FTModule accessors to their own file

N.B.: remove time spent on "tentative" items if they don't end up in a deliverable

immediate next steps
--------------------
Generate metronome data from patterns
Generate list of (tick, note-on) pairs
Make hash table to look up instruments and macros
Interpret volume envelopes
Interpret timbre envelopes
Interpret arpeggio envelopes
Interpret pitch envelopes
Interpret effects one by one as encountered
