1 h Begin writing plan and structs

Tue 05-17
1 h Make a wavetable mixer
.25 h Set up VC; plan to write test tracks

Wed 05-18
1 h Make a test track; realize need for a hash table to parse it
2.5 h Begin hash table [tentative]

Thu 05-19
.25 h Collect 2 more test tracks

Sun 05-22
.75 h Build keyword hash function

Thu 05-26
3 h Parse instrument data in a FamiTracker text export

N.B.: remove time spent on "tentative" items if they don't end up in a deliverable

immediate next steps
--------------------
Parse sequence data (ORDER)
Parse sequence data (ROW)
Stuff instrument data into a struct
Stuff track data into a struct
Make hash table to look up instruments and macros
