1 h Begin writing plan and structs

Tue 05-17
1 h Make a wavetable mixer
.25 h Set up VC; plan to write test tracks

Wed 05-18
1 h Make a test track; realize need for a hash table to parse it
2.5 h Begin hash table [tentative]

Thu 05-19
.25 h Collect 2 more test tracks

Sun 05-22
.75 h Build keyword hash function

Thu 05-26
3.5 h Parse instrument and order data in a FamiTracker text export

Mon 05-30
1 h Parse pattern note, instrument, and volume

N.B.: remove time spent on "tentative" items if they don't end up in a deliverable

immediate next steps
--------------------
Parse sequence effect data
Ensure the whole row is parsed
Stuff instrument data into a struct
Stuff track data into a struct
Make hash table to look up instruments and macros
